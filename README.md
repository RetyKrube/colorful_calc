# Colorful Calculator
A calculator with a GUI that randomizes colors (fair warning to your eyes)

## Getting Started
This is a Python program that creates a calculator with a colorful theme using the tkinter library. The calculator allows the user to perform basic operations with a color-changing background, and color-changing widgets (buttons and prompt field).

### Installation
To use this program, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

### Running the Program

1. Download the Python code from the repository or copy the code to a local file with a `.py` extension.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the program is saved.
3. Run the program by entering the following command:

	```
	python colorful_calc.py
	```
4. Once you execute the program, a new window will pop up, and you can start using the calculator by clicking on the buttons.

### Note: If you try to short cut an operation by entering `5`, `*` and then `=` a prompt will appear in the entry field saying "Please try again". You'll need to click the `C` button before starting another operation. I will do my best fix this in the near future.

## Usage
To use this program, simply run it following the instructions above or you may copy the code into your IDE/Code editor. Once the program is running, you can use the buttons to perform basic operations. 

Only 20 numbers are allowed in the entry field and if you try to divide by zero, a message will pop up saying "Undefined".

The prompt at the top of the window will display the numbers and operations you have entered, and the result will be displayed once you click the `=` button.

## Feedback
If you have any feedback or suggestions on how to improve this program, feel free to reach out to me. Feedback is greatly appreciated.

## WARNING: This program has a theme that involves rapidly changing colors, which can cause some discomfort, and may cause harm to those with photosensitive epilepsy or other visual sensitivities. Please use this program with caution and discretion, and stop using it immediately if you experience any sort of discomfort.
